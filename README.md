OrderingApplication

## Description
Ordering application is a mock up designed as regard to requirements specified below. Few design elements of this mock up are not entirely build as the requirements described, but closely related.

## How-to-run
1. Open Android Studio 
2. Check out project from version control using Github > https://github.com/wnyao/ordering_application.git
3. Run on emulator with SdkVersion 26 and above

## Fulfilled Requirements
* List of mock menu items with item picture, name, and price display on landing activity.
* Info of menu item, with ability to add to cart and quality selector (by clicking on the amount number at info page)
* Cart page which list the items added to cart
* Remove feature for cart item (ability to remove item is still inconsistent)

## Requirements
Ordering application is a mock up with below requirements:
* **Page 1:** List of mock menu items with item picture, price, short description, and ability to add item to Cart with quantity selector.
* **Page 2:** Cart page which lists the items previously added. User should be able to remove items from cart, and also submit their Cart as an order. No backend is required for this app, simply assume that the order data will be sent somewhere and clear the cart on the client

Bonus points for:
* Data persistence through app restarts
* Frequent git commits in your project with concise commit messages
* Instructions to clone and run on a local machine (linux/macOS)
* Any backend setup that receives the order data and gives a response to the client
